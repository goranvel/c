# c
This is repo where I keep my C code. I do mess around quite a lot.
I also do code on the fly whenever I have little time. Thus a lot of times I do not comment my code. THat is changing though, as I see the code I go back and comment it.

Bare in mind some of this code is testing of bugs glitches, compilers and Standards, so some things might not work on all
machines.
    EXAMPLE: arr[pos++]
             You will see this in my code a lot, but this is not up to standard and should not be used I do it
             because I like to live on the edge.
