# c
This is repo where I keep my C code. I do mess around quite a lot.
I also do code on the fly whenever I have little time so sometimes I did not comment my code. THat is changing.

Bare in mind some of this code is testing of bugs glitches, compilers and Standards, so some things might not work on all
machines.
    EXAMPLE: arr[pos++]
             You will see this in my code a lot, but this is not up to standard and should not be used I do it
             because I like to test the edge.
